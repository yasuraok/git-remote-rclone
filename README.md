# Git remote helper for rclone-supported services

_**TL;DR: Turn most cloud storage services (eg: Dropbox) into remote git services, with
optional encryption.**_

This is a [Git remote helper](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote-helpers) for
backends supported by [rclone](https://rclone.org).

This enables using `git pull` or `git push` with a remote git repository stored on
popular cloud services with no native Git support. Optionally, it enables using
zero-knowledge encryption via [rclone's crypt](https://rclone.org/crypt/).

## Installation and Usage

- Visit the [rclone website](https://rclone.org) and follow the instructions for
  installation of `rclone`, and configuration of access to the desired service(s).

- Install this package:
  ```
   pip3 install git-remote-rclone-reds
  ```
  or place the `git-remote-rclone` executable provided here into the system path, such
  that Git can find it. 

Now it is possible to use URLs like
`rclone://<remote>/<path-on-remote>` as push and pull URLs for Git.

For example, if access to a DropBox account has been configured as an rclone-remote
named `mydropbox`, the URL `rclone://mydropbox/myrepository` identifies a remote
in a directory `myrepository/` under this DropBox account.

## Example
```
mkdir testrepo; cd testrepo
git init .
echo "Hello world." > xyz
git add xyz
git commit -m "Initial commit."
rclone mkdir mydropbox:test  # Assuming 'mydropbox' has been configured
git remote add rclone://mydropbox/test
git remote add origin rclone://mydropbox/test
git push origin -u main
```

## Technical details

At the remote end, `git-remote-rclone` maintains a directory with two files:

- `refs`: a small text file listing the refs provided by the remote
- `repo-<SHA>.tar.gz`: an archive of a bare Git repository

When interacting with a remote, `git-remote-rclone` obtains and extracts a copy
of the remote repository archive (placed at `.git/rclone/<remote-name>` in the
local Git repository). All Git operations are performed locally. Whenever the
state of the mirror repository has changed, it is compacted to minimize transfer
size and uploaded to the remote storage service. Likewise, the remote storage
service is checked for updates before the local mirror repository is updated.

`git-remote-rclone` aims to minimize API usage of remote storage services. Per
invocation, it only queries for the filenames in the remote repository archive,
downloads two files (if needed), and uploads two files (if needed, and on push only).

### Tested with

- `rclone` 1.63.1
- Google Drive
- Onedrive
- DropBox
- [Rclone crypt](https://rclone.org/crypt/)

### Repo migration

`git-remote-rclone-reds` is *not* backward compatible with (cannot directly read/write) existing remotes created by [datalad/git-remote-rclone](https://github.com/datalad/git-remote-rclone). Migrating a repo is required.

However, migrating a repo back and forth between `git-remote-rclone` and
`git-remote-rclone-reds` is very easy. A small one-time change is required. Instead of
`repo.7z`, `git-remote-rclone-reds` uses `repo-SHA.tar.gz`. So in theory, you could
unpack, repack, and rename, using the
[`compute_sha.py`](https://github.com/redstreet/git-remote-rclone/blob/main/compute_sha.py)
that ships with `git-remote-rclone-reds`, and that works fine.

But there's a much easier way, which is to get git to do all the work:

```
# Upgrade to git-remote-rclone-reds
pip3 uninstall git-remote-rclone
pip3 install git-remote-rclone-reds

# Upgrade the repo.
git remote -v
origin  rclone://cloud/old (fetch)
origin  rclone://cloud/old (push)

git remote add new rclone://cloud/new
git push -u new main

# You can now verify rclone://cloud/new looks right, and then rename it to `origin`
```
This works for migrations in the opposite direction too.

## Acknowledgements

This work is based on [datalad/git-remote-rclone](https://github.com/datalad/git-remote-rclone). This work changes the
design for compatibility with rclone backends like crypt that do not support file
[hashes](https://github.com/datalad/git-remote-rclone/issues/6).
